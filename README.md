## Features
- Tight loop: grab every diskette, spawn the exit, and escape while drones oscillate on lanes.
- Lives + heat: limited hearts; lingering overheats the grid and spawns an extra fast drone.
- Stage skipping with risk: ADVANCE jumps ahead but burns one life; RESET rerolls the current layout.

## Controls
- Move: Arrow keys / WASD or on-screen D-pad.
- Reset: Space or RESET button.
- Advance: ADVANCE (costs one life) to skip to a harder stage.
- Survive: heat spike adds another drone if you wait too long; losing all lives sends you back to stage 1 with full hearts.
